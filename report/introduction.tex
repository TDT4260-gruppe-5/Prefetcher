The gap between processor speed and main memory speed has for many years increased
dramatically\cite{IEEEexample:biblatex}. To
attack this problem several solutions has been proposed and implemented. One of them is prefetching
where the processor fetches instructions and data from memory in advance, before it is used.
Prefetching attempts to decrease the average memory access time and thereby increases the overall
computer efficiency. More specifically it tries to reduce the miss rate in the average memory access
time equation $ \textit{hit rate} \times \textit{hit time} + \textit{miss rate} \times \textit{miss penalty} $.

Several schemes can be used to implement a prefetcher. Our prefetcher uses a scheme called
\emph{stride}. It essentially consists of a table that is index by the program counter (PC) and it
stores, amongst other things, a stride that is the difference between the two most recent memory
accesses for a particular load instruction. When the prefetcher detects a pattern in the strides it
uses the stride value to prefetch what it assumes to be data that the processor needs in the near
future.
