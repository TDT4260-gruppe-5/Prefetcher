In this paper we have presented our own prefetcher based on the principles of
strides. It tries to match patterns in the access history on a local (per PC)
basis. We try to find a perfect match, and if this is not found, we fall back
on Most Common Stride.

After thorough testing with different values for the parameters, our prefetcher
achieved an average speedup of 10.4\% compared to no prefetcher.

\subsection{Future Work}
There are a few cases we think would be interesting to look at, but did not have
time to test. The first one would be to prefetch all most common strides, not
just the first one. Currently if there is the same number of two different
strides, say 128 and 192, only the first one will be prefetched.

Another thing we think could be worth looking at is making the most common
stride threshold dependent on the the number of the most common stride.
That way more strides in common would result in more cachelines fetched.

Finally it could be interesting to look at using relative strides instead of
absolute strides, and only focus on perfect matches. It is possible this would
allow less bits per access while keeping the same performance.
