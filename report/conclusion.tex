In this paper we have presented our own prefetcher based on the principles of strides. It tries to match patterns in the access history on a local (per PC) basis. We try to find a perfect match, and if this is not found, then we fall back on Most Common Stride.

After thorough tweaking of parameters, our prefetcher acheived a speedup of \speedup compared to no prefetcher.
