A lot of work has been done in this field, resulting in many different
prefetching heuristics. They range from the very simple sequential ones, that
simply fetches the address after the current one, to more complex ones that
tries to find patterns and use dynamically gathered statistics to guide them.

Our prefetcher is a stride prefetcher.
