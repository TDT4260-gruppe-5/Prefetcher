A lot of work has been done in this field, resulting in many different prefetching heuristics. They
range from the very simple sequential ones, that simply fetches the address after the current one,
to more complex ones that tries to find patterns and use dynamically gathered statistics to guide
them \cite{prefetch_range}.

\subsection{Delta Correlation Prediction Tables} 
Delta Correlation Prediction Tables (DCPT) combines RPT (Reference Prediction Tables) and PC/DC
(Program Counter/Delta Correlation Prefetching) \cite{dcpt}. A large table is indexed by the program
counter and Fig~\ref{fig:dcpt_entry} shows an entry in the table.
