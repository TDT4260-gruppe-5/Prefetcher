A lot of work has been done in this field, resulting in many different
prefetching heuristics. They range from the very simple sequential ones, that
simply fetches the address after the current one, to more complex ones that
tries to find patterns and use dynamically gathered statistics to guide them.

An important subclass of prefetchers is stride prefetchers. These try to find a
pattern in the difference between consecutive memory addresses (called a
stride). If a pattern of strides is found it can be used to prefetch the next
address that will be needed. Our prefetcher is a stride prefetcher.
