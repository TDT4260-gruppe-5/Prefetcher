Fig.~\ref{fig:prefetcher_speedup} shows the speedup of our best prefetcher
compared to running the test without a prefetcher. As you can see from the
chart there is an all-round good speedup, in addition to certain test which
have higher speedup. Only the \emph{twolf} benchmark runs slower with the
prefetcher.

\subsection{Table Parameters}
Fig.~\ref{fig:table_size_chart} shows the speedup with different table sizes.
%As you can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:table_size_chart}, the performance stopped
%increasing after a table size of 256. This we believe is caused by instruction
%conflicts in the table. When the table reaches a certain size, most
%instructions get their own place in the table, and avoid being evicted by
%conflicting instructions.

\subsection{Most Common Stride Parameters}

The final solution was selected after thorough testing and tweaking of the
prefetcher. The different results from the tests can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:prefetcher_tweaks}. Each line represents different values for the
threshold, and the x-axis shows the values for the count variable.
