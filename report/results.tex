Fig.~\ref{fig:prefetcher_speedup} shows our prefetcher's speedup compared to running the test without a prefetcher. As you can see from the chart there is an all-round good speedup, in addition to certain test which have higher speedup.

As you can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:table_size_chart}, the performance stopped increasing after a table size of 256. This we believe is caused by instruction conflicts in the table. When the table reaches a certain size, most instructions get their own place in the table, and avoid being evicted by conflicting instructions.

The final solution was selected after thorough testing and tweaking of the prefetcher. The different results form the tests can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:prefetcher_tweaks}. Each line represents different values for the threshold, and the x-axis shows the values for the count variable.
