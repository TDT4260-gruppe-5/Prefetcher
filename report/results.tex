Fig.~\ref{fig:prefetcher_speedup} shows the speedup of our best prefetcher
compared with no prefetcher and DCPT and RPT mentioned in Related Work.
%compared to running the test without a prefetcher.
As you can see from the
chart there is an all-round good speedup, in addition to certain test which
have higher speedup. Only the \emph{twolf} benchmark runs slower with the
prefetcher.

\subsection{Table Parameters}
We tested with different values for table size, pattern size and bits per address.
Fig.~\ref{fig:table_size_chart} shows the speedup with different table sizes.
Fig.~\ref{fig:pattern_size} shows the speedup with different pattern sizes.
Fig.~\ref{fig:bits} shows the results from using various bits per access.

\subsection{Pattern Matching Results}
For the pattern matching code we tried varying both aggressiveness and
threshold. Fig.~\ref{fig:aggr} shows the speedup with the aggressiveness set to
a fraction of the pattern size. We get the best result when the aggressiveness
is $\frac{5}{6}$ of the pattern size.

We also tried tuning the threshold, from perfect matching to various kinds of
partial matching, but the results were discouraging. Perfect matching was
better in all cases.

\subsection{Most Common Stride Parameters}

For the most common stride part of the algorithm we tested different parameters
for aggressiveness and threshold. Fig.~\ref{fig:mcs_tweaks} shows the results
of the different simulations.
The reason for the extra data point for Threshold=4 was that the line went
up from 7 to 8. We therefore chose to run an extra test to check if the
trend continued with aggressiveness=9.
