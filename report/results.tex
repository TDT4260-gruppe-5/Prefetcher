Fig.~\ref{fig:prefetcher_speedup} shows our prefetcher's speedup compared to running the test without a prefetcher. As you can see from the chart there is an all-round good speedup, in addition to certain test which have higher speedup.

As you can see from Fig.~\ref{fig:table_size_chart}, the performance stopped increasing after a table size of 256. This we believe is caused by instruction conflicts in the table. When the table reaches a certain size, most instructions get their own place in the table, and avoid being evicted by conflicting instructions.
