To evaluate the performance of various prefetchers, we have used
a subset of the SPEC CPU2000 benchmarks in association with the M5
simulator. The benchmarks were started at a checkpoint taken after
1,000,000,000 instructions, and then run for 100,000,000 instructions.
The simulated computer uses an ALPHA CPU running at 2GHz
with a 2-way 64KB L1 data cache. It also has an 8-way 2MB L2 cache that is
connected to main memory by an 8 byte wide bus running at
400MHz. Main memory has a latency of 30ns.
