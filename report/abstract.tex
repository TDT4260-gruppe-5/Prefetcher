In this paper we present a stride prefetcher that uses pattern matching and
most common stride. It is influenced by Delta Correlation Prediction Table
prefetchers, but instead of storing delta values it stores addresses.

The prefetcher first looks for a perfect or partial matching among the delta
values calculated from the addresses, but if that fails it looks for the most
common stride.

Using the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite together with the M5 simulator, the
resulting prefetcher achieves an average speedup of 10.4\% compared to no
prefetcher at all. Max achieved speedup was 60\% with the \emph{ammp} program.
