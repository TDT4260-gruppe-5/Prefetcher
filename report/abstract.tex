In this paper we present a stride prefetcher that is influenced by Delta Correlation
Prediction Table prefetchers. The data structure used requires less bits per entry than the
DCPT, allowing it to have more entries in the table. 

Using the SPEC CPU2000 benchmark suite the resulting prefetcher achieves a 
speedup of \speedup compared to no prefetcher at all.
